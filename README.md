# locust-demo

This is a demo project that shows how to get started using Locust as a performance testing tool.

This project will show steps on how to run tests vs apis and web pages. There is boilerplate code here as well that 
shows how to customize this for your own tests.

I have added dependencies for this project in the requirements.txt file

Do check the official page of [Locust](https://www.locust.io) for more details
